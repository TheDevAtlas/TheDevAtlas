👾 Jacob McGowan – TheDevAtlas

**'Game Developer | Programmer'**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Jacob McGowan, also known as TheDevAtlas - a programmer and content creator who loves exploring the intersection of technology, gaming, and creativity. Here you’ll find repositories tied to my projects, experiments, and YouTube videos, where I dive into:

🎮 Game development and experimental mechanics

🗃️ Video game preservation and tools

💻 Programming projects that mix utility with creativity

I publish these projects on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thedevatlas) and [Website](https://www.thedevatlas.com/), documenting my process along the way. My goal is to share knowledge, spark ideas, and inspire others to explore what’s possible when tech and creativity collide.
