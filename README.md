Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Jacob McGowan, also known as TheDevAtlas, a programmer and content creator who loves exploring the intersection of technology, gaming, and creativity. Here, youâ€™ll find repositories tied to my projects and YouTube videos, where I dive into game development, video game preservation, and programming experiments. I publish these on my YouTube [TheDevAtlas](https://www.youtube.com/@thedevatlas) and on my website [thedevatlas.com](https://www.thedevatlas.com/).
