### Jacob McGowan's TheDevAtlas

**'Computer Science Student & Programming Teacher'**

I build projects that both interest me and have some interesting real world aplicatoins... or a game jam, whichever comes first. All of my projects build on what I want to learn at home (marching cubes, compute shaders, game dev, ect.) or what I am learning at school (calculus, physics, data structures, AI, ect.) at any given time. My videos and articls that I create come from the projects that I consider my best or the ones that I learned a lot by doing. I publish these on my YouTube "[TheDevAtlas](https://www.youtube.com/@thedevatlas)" and on my website "[thedevatlas.com](https://www.thedevatlas.com/)".
